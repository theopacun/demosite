    <h2 class="top-title" id="quickStart">Quick Start</h1>
        <p>All Spektrix integrations at this time require the use of an iframe in order to sell tickets online via your website. A lot of this text is generated automatically from the Spektrix system. However identifying the exact locations of where this text might be edited, as well as where it will appear on the given iframes is sometimes unclear.</p>
        <p>Using this site, you can navigate a generic purchase path marked with additional information on specific locations that the text is pulling through. If you know which iframe you'd like to look at, you can start directly with on of the links on the left.</p>
